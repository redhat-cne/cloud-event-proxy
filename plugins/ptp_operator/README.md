# PTP Operator plugin

The PTP Operator plugin in cloud-event-proxy's role is to parse the logs generated by the linuxptp-daemon container and generate cloud-events from them.
This is also where the holdover logic is implemented.
The PTP operator plugin also gets GNSS events via a socket from the linuxptp-daemon which also is translated to cloud-events.

Events test on the following tested configurations: [Configurations](docs/configurations.md)
